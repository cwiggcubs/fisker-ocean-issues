# fisker-ocean-issues
Repo to help Fisker Ocean owners organize issues and track resolution from Fisker. This site is not affiliated with Fisker in any way. This is my log of issues to help organize my support cases. Please don't hesitate to add your issues. I will continue to add more structure to this project as I get feedback.

Update: 11/13/2023 - The Fisker service truck came to update my Fisker Ocean One to software v1.10.  I will go through all the issues to check which items were resolved with the latest update.

Update: 10 Dec 2023 - I have several tickets open with Fisker Support and occasionally receive an email asking if the problem persists, but no solution.  I've added the new issues seen this week.  Hopefully some software engineering help is on the way.  Whew, we have a long way to go.
