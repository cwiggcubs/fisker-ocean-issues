# fisker-ocean-issues
Repo to help Fisker Ocean owners organize issues and track resolution from Fisker. This site is not affiliated with Fisker in any way. This is my log of issues to help organize my support cases. Please don't hesitate to add your issues. I will continue to add more structure to this project as I get feedback.

This list started at https://tree.taiga.io/project/fisker-ocean-adm-fisker-ocean-issues/issues but the user interface was too clunky.  I'll work on pulling all the issues and pictures from the other site over the next few days.

Update: 11/13/2023 - The Fisker service truck came to update my Fisker Ocean One to software v1.10.  I will go through all the issues to check which items were resolved with the latest update.
